# Fish Traceability Blockchain

Solidity blockchain based on 2 smart contracts for improved traceability in the fish processing industry.

In this example project, fish are first NFC-tagged and registered by fishermen using a Product Registration Contract (PRC). This allows tracking them from the very beginning of their trip to the consumer's plate. 
Afterwards all purchases and sales of the fish are stored in a Transaction History Contract (THC).
Finally, the consumer can scan the NFC tag to check information about the fishing conditions, the freshness of the fish and the intermediaries having played a role in processing the edible they are about to buy.
